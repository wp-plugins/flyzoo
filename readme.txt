= Will the chat slow down my site? =

No. The chat is loaded asynchronously after your main content, our servers will handle all the chat workload.

= After removing the chat plugin it still shows on the frontend, how do I remove it completely? =

Probably your pages are being cached. Please try the following:

- refresh your browser's cache
- if you are using a caching plugin please, force a refresh

this should solve the issue in 99% of cases.

Otherwise, please check that you haven't embedded the chat script into some .php file (like footer.php for instance).
