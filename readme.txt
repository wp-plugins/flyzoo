== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it free? =

We are currently in Beta and the product is free. Of course we'll introduce
premium plans for advanced features soon, but we'll also keep a free
version of Flyzoo for small sites.

= How do I create a new Chatroom? =

Just log into the widget (on your site) using your administrative account,
then click on the "CHATS" icon on the widget and here you'll find the "CREATE NEW CHAT" button.
Note: only the administrator and site operators are allowed to create chatrooms!

= System Requirements?  =

Flyzoo requires the jQuery library.
If your site is not running jQuery, Flyzoo will load it automatically.
If your site is running jQuery, Flyzoo supports jQuery 1.3.1+ along with jQuery UI 1.8.24+, 
though we suggest to upgrade to the latest jQuery version if possible. 

= Will the widget slow down my site? =

No. The widget is loaded asynchronously right after your main content has been loaded.

= After I remove and delete the plugin it still shows on the frontend, how do i remove it completely? =

Please try the following:

- refresh your browser's cache
- if you are using a caching plugin please force a cache refresh

this should solve the issue in 99% of cases.

Otherwise, please check that the script has not been embedded directly into
some .php file (footer.php for instance).

= Can I suggest a feature?  =

Yes of course. We love feedbacks so let's keep in touch!
