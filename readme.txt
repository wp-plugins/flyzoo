== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it free? =

Yes! We are currently in Beta and the product is free. We'll also keep the product free
after the Beta, and offer premium plans for advanced features. 

= System Requirements?  =

Flyzoo makes extensive use of the JQuery library.
If your site is not running jQuery, Flyzoo will load it automatically.
If your site is running JQuery, Flyzoo supports JQuery 1.3.1+ along with jQuery UI 1.8.24+, 
though we suggest to upgrade to the latest jQuery version if possible. 

= Can I suggest a feature?  =

Sure, we are in Beta now. We love feedbacks so let's get in touch!
