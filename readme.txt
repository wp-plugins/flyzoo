No, the chat is loaded asynchronously after the main content and our servers will handle all the chat workload.

Probably pages are being cached. Please try to:

- refresh your browser's cache
- if you are using a caching plugin, force a refresh: this should fix the issue.

Otherwise, please check that you haven't embedded the chat script into some .php file - like footer.php for instance.
